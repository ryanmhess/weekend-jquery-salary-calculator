# Annual Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 10 hours_

This project required the ability to create employee objects containing first name, last name, emplyee ID, title and annual salary. Each employee object 
then needed to be added to an employees array. The employees array was utilized to create a table display of each employee data set using html and css.
Using the employee data categories, inputs were created for each with a submit button to add new employees to the table display and the employees array.
Delete buttons were also needed for each employee data set to allow users to remove them from the table display and the employees array. Finally, a 
total salary was calculated and updates based on added and deleted employees.

## Usage

1. Enter appropriate data in the input fields
2. Click submit
3. Review table data, employee/salary total
4. Delete any incorrect employees
5. Rinse & Repeat as needed

## Built With
